# Software-Construction-Assignment
The goal of this assignment was to:
- Apply OOP principles (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).
- Convert UML diagrams into Java code using **classes** and **interfaces**.
- Use appropriate design patterns to make the code reusable and extensible.
- Demonstrate the functionality of each design in a `main()` method.
